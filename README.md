#Kafka4n 
I was not able to find any C# client that was written for the 0.8 version of the Apache Kafka bus so I decided
to write one. Its based on the .NET Kafak Client here https://github.com/kafka-dev/kafka/blob/master/clients/csharp
There are a lot of changes made to the code because of the difference in the protocol between 0.7 and 0.8
The project is in an very early state at the moment and I hope I will get time to put more work into it soon

I started this project because I want to explore the concept of µ-services and needed a C# client. The code is
used in one of my hobby projects at the moment and is not considered 'industrial strength' with full exception handling
and test coverage.
